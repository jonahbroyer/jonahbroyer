I’ve been enjoying learning technology ever since I could type my name into CD-ROM games when I was two. I have a strong passion for music that I incorporated into my sentiment analysis capstone project. I worked on an innovative pipeline that collects data from classical music concert programs and outputs them into datasets for deep learning algorithms such as NLP. The goal is to discover how different genres of music affect audiences emotionally. I’m currently on the lookout for a role where I can make an impact quickly!
